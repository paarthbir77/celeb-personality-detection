Deepika Padukone should stop interfering in my life and concentrate on her work Kangana Ranaut [Throwback]

Deepika Padukone, Kangana RanautVarinder Chawla
Kangana Ranaut had never shied away from expressing her dislike for Deepika Padukone on a public platform
 The two have been at loggerheads ever since Deepika won the Best Actress award for her performance in Happy New Year over Kanganas role in Queen at an award function in 2014
When Deepika went on stage to collect her Best Actress award, she dedicated it to Kangana for her brilliant performance in Queen
 This kind gesture from Deepika on a public platform didnt go down well with Kangana
When Kangana was asked about Deepikas gesture of dedicating the award to her, the Queen actress had said in an interview that she would have appreciated if Deepika would have told her in person what she felt about her performance
Shortly after, Kangana had openly admitted to being not friends with Deepika during an interview with Rajeev Masand
Kanganas direct jibe at Deepika

Kangana even took a direct jibe at Deepika saying that she should stop interfering in her life
Later, when Deepika was asked about her infamous cold war with Kangana, she told the media that it was one-sided and irrelevant
 I have way too much going on in my life so what people say, what people do, what people think is really irrelevant, Deepika was quoted as saying by Filmfare
Though Kangana had later tried to make peace with Deepika by defending her choice of outfit at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2016, she continues to criticise Deepika even today, be it for visit to JNU or her TikTok video on acid attack survivors
